Base64-categories
=================

Objective-C Wrapper for the migbase64 fast Base64 conversion libraries

The migbase64 conversion libraries (originally written in Java) provide very fast and
memory efficient conversion to and from Base64 encodings.

The two files 'MIGConverter.c' and 'MIGConverter.h' are ports of the code originally
written Java to raw C.  Fundamentally, the only changes required were for handling
parameter passing and to unroll a 'static' function that prepared an intermediary 
array for fast processing.

The two files 'Base64+categories.m' and 'Base64+categories.h' are an Objective-C (ARC)
wrapper on the top of the migbase64 port.
